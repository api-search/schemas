Respond to this challenge with <code>NEW_PASSWORD</code> and any required attributes that Amazon Cognito returned in the <code>requiredAttributes</code> parameter. You can also set values for attributes that aren't required by your user pool and that your app client can write.

In <code>AdminRespondToAuthChallenge</code>, set a value for any keys that Amazon Cognito returned in the <code>requiredAttributes</code> parameter, then use the <code>AdminUpdateUserAttributes</code> API operation to modify the value of any additional attributes.</p> </note> </li> <li> <p> <code>MFA_SETUP</code>: For users who are required to set up an MFA factor before they can sign in. The MFA types activated for the user pool will be listed in the challenge parameters <code>MFA_CAN_SETUP</code> value. </p> <p> To set up software token MFA, use the session returned here from <code>InitiateAuth</code> as an input to <code>AssociateSoftwareToken</code>, and use the session returned by <code>VerifySoftwareToken</code> as an input to <code>RespondToAuthChallenge</code> with challenge name <code>MFA_SETUP</code> to complete sign-in. To set up SMS MFA, users will need help from an administrator to add a phone number to their account and then call <code>InitiateAuth</code> again\
