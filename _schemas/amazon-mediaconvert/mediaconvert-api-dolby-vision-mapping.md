description: Required when you set Dolby Vision Profile to Profile 8.1. When you set Content mapping to None, content mapping is not applied to the HDR10-compatible signal. Depending on the source peak nit level, clipping might occur on HDR devices without Dolby Vision. When you set Content mapping to HDR10 1000, the transcoder creates a 1,000 nits peak HDR10-compatible signal by applying static content mapping to the source. This mode is speed-optimized for PQ10 sources with metadata that is created from analysis. For graded Dolby Vision content, be aware that creative intent might not be guaranteed with extreme 1,000 nits trims.
