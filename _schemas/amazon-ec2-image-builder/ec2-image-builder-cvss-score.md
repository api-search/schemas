description: Amazon Inspector generates a risk score for each finding. This score helps you to prioritize findings, to focus on the most critical findings and the most vulnerable resources. The score uses the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) format. This format is a modification of the base CVSS score that the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) provides. For more information about severity levels, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/findings-understanding-severity.html">Severity levels for Amazon Inspector findings</a> in the <i>Amazon Inspector User Guide</i>.
